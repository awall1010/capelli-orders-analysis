    "## Long Sleeve Filtering: Overview & Weekly Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook ingests the *‚ÄúDetails Category‚Äù* tab from the weekly Capelli report and produces two outputs:\n",
    "1. **Player-Level Long Sleeve Summary** ‚Äì aggregates purchase history per player, flags ‚ÄúHome‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúAway‚Äù long-sleeve purchases, and saves to `LongSleeveOrders/<DATE>Order_Summary_with_ls_status.csv`.  \n",
    "2. **Merged Detail File** ‚Äì merges each player‚Äôs long-sleeve status back into the raw detail exports, writing to `LongSleeveOrders/Rush Soccer <DATE> - Details_with_ls_status.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ What You Need to Update Weekly\n",
    "- **Input File Path**  \n",
    "  - Change the CSV filename in the `pd.read_csv(...)` call to match the **new weekly** export inside the directory `shippingdates/`.  \n",
    "- **Club Filter (Optional)**  \n",
    "  - If analyzing a **single club**, uncomment and set `df = df[df[\"Club Name\"] == \"<YOUR CLUB>\"]`.  \n",
    "- **Long-Sleeve Product Names**  \n",
    "  - Update the `home_ls` and `away_ls` strings to exactly match the **Product Name** entries for ‚ÄúHome Long Sleeve‚Äù and ‚ÄúAway Long Sleeve‚Äù in your report.  \n",
    "- **Output Paths**  \n",
    "  - The two `to_csv(...)` calls write into `LongSleeveOrders/`.  \n",
    "  - Rename files to include the **current date** (e.g. `Rush Soccer 5.4‚Ä¶`, `5.4Order_Summary‚Ä¶`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã How It Works\n",
    "1. **Read & (Optionally) Filter**  \n",
    "   - Load the category-detail CSV, then optionally restrict to one **Club Name** and specific **Category** values.  \n",
    "2. **Date & Year Filtering**  \n",
    "   - Converts the ‚ÄúOrder Date‚Äù column to datetime and filters to the current year (e.g. 2025).  \n",
    "3. **Define Target Products**  \n",
    "   - Assign exact **Product Name** strings to `home_ls` and `away_ls`.  \n",
    "4. **Compute Player-Level Status**  \n",
    "   - Group by **Player ID**, aggregate product names into lists, then count occurrences of each long sleeve SKU.  \n",
    "   - Classify each player as:  \n",
    "     - ‚ÄúDid Not Purchase Long Sleeve‚Äù  \n",
    "     - ‚ÄúPurchased Only Home Long Sleeve (#)‚Äù  \n",
    "     - ‚ÄúPurchased Only Away Long Sleeve (#)‚Äù  \n",
    "     - ‚ÄúPurchased Both Long Sleeves (#)‚Äù  \n",
    "5. **Save Outputs**  \n",
    "   - **Summary CSV**: one row per player with status and counts.  \n",
    "   - **Merged CSV**: original detail rows enriched with each player‚Äôs long-sleeve status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This notebook is designed to process **one club at a time**. You must supply the correct Club Name filter and the exact Product Name values for that club‚Äôs long-sleeve SKUs before running.\n",
