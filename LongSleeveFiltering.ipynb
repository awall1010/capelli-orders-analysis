    "\n",
    "4. **Long-sleeve detection**  \n",
    "   * Aggregates each player‚Äôs *Product Name* list.  \n",
    "   * Counts matches to `home_ls` and `away_ls`.  \n",
    "   * Assigns **Long Sleeve Status**:  \n",
    "     - `Purchased Only Home Long Sleeve (#)`  \n",
    "     - `Purchased Only Away Long Sleeve (#)`  \n",
    "     - `Purchased Both Long Sleeves (#)`  \n",
    "     - `Did Not Purchase Long Sleeve`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Console summary**  \n",
    "   Prints player counts per status and total Home / Away quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Excel export**  \n",
    "   * Builds filename: **`<Club> Long Sleeve <MM.DD> Report.xlsx`** (`MM.DD` parsed from the CSV name).  \n",
    "   * Writes four data-frames to the workbook (see table above) using **`xlsxwriter`**.  \n",

    "2. **Merged Detail File** ‚Äì merges each player‚Äôs long-sleeve status back into the raw detail exports, writing to `LongSleeveOrders/Rush Soccer <DATE> - Details_with_ls_status.csv`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ What You Need to Update Weekly\n",
    "- **Input File Path**  \n",

    "- **Club Filter (Optional)**  \n",

    "- **Long-Sleeve Product Names**  \n",

    "- **Output Paths**  \n",

    "3. **Define Target Products**  \n",
    "   - Assign exact **Product Name** strings to `home_ls` and `away_ls`.  \n",
    "4. **Compute Player-Level Status**  \n",
    "   - Group by **Player ID**, aggregate product names into lists, then count occurrences of each long sleeve SKU.  \n",
